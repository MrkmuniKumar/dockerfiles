## Consolidated Hands-On Security Questions (First 5 Sets)

Here are the first 5 sets of hands-on security questions, with no repetition, containing five unique questions each:

**Set 1**

1. **Hands-on (RBAC & NIST):** Design a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for a three-tier e-commerce application using the NIST Special Publication 800-30 framework. Identify user roles, permissions, and access levels for each tier.
2. **Situation-based (Security):** You identify suspicious activity on your company's web server logs. Describe the steps you would take to investigate the potential security threat.
3. **Theoretical (COBIT):** Explain the five principles of COBIT for IT governance and their importance in managing an IT organization.
4. **Hands-on (Automation):** Write a script (pseudocode or specific language) to automate the deployment of a new web application to a development server environment.
5. **Threat Modeling:** Describe the STRIDE threat modeling methodology and its benefits for identifying potential security threats in a system.

**Set 2**

1. **Hands-on (DevOps & Security):**  Using a DevOps pipeline diagram, illustrate the integration of security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 
2. **Situation-based (ITIL):** Your company's service desk experiences a surge in incident tickets due to a recent software update.  How would you utilize the ITIL incident management process to resolve these incidents efficiently?
3. **Theoretical (CISM):** Explain the concept of information security governance and its key components according to the CISM framework.
4. **Hands-on (Security Scripting):** Write a basic script (pseudocode or specific language) to scan a list of IP addresses for open ports using a common vulnerability scanner tool.
5. **NIST:** Briefly describe the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) core functions and their role in managing cybersecurity risk.

**Set 3**

1. **Hands-on (Web Security Scripting):** Write a script (pseudocode or specific language) to automate the process of scanning a website for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) using a publicly available web vulnerability scanner library. 
2. **Situation-based (Network Security):** You suspect a network intrusion on your company network. Describe the steps you would take to identify the source of the attack and isolate the compromised device.
3. **Theoretical (Secure Coding):** Explain the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks and how secure coding practices can mitigate these vulnerabilities.
4. **Hands-on (Security Policy Update):**  Review your existing password policy and propose updates to strengthen password complexity requirements and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
5. **Cloud Security:** Discuss the concept of cloud security posture management (CSPM) and its benefits for maintaining a secure cloud environment.

**Set 4**

1. **Hands-on (Password Hashing):**  Write a script (pseudocode or specific language) to demonstrate how password hashing works. The script should take a plain-text password as input and generate a secure hash using a common hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).
2. **Situation-based (Incident Response & Forensics):** A ransomware attack encrypts critical company data. Describe the initial steps you would take to isolate the attack and begin the incident response and forensic analysis process.
3. **Theoretical (Security Monitoring):** Explain the difference between Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and their roles in network security monitoring.
4. **Hands-on (Security Logging):**  Write a script (pseudocode or specific language) to parse system logs and identify potential suspicious activity based on predefined log entries.
5. **Container Security:** Discuss best practices for securing container registries, including access control and vulnerability scanning.

**Set 5**

1. **Hands-on (Security Tool):**  Explore a vulnerability scanner tool like Nessus or OpenVAS. Write steps on how to use the tool to scan a system for vulnerabilities and generate a report.
2. **Situation-based (Physical Security):** A server room access badge is lost. Explain the steps you would take to secure the server room and prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Theoretical (Penetration Testing):** Briefly explain the different phases of a penetration testing methodology and the ethical considerations involved.
4. **Hands-on (Security Awareness Training):** Develop a short security awareness training module for employees on best practices for identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.
5. **Cloud Security:** Discuss the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its security implications for managing cloud resources.
