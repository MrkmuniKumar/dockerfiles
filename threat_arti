| **Storage of Vulnerable Artifacts**                             | Storing artifacts that contain known vulnerabilities, leading to potential exposure if deployed.                                                     | Implement automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., JFrog Xray) before storing artifacts.                                                               | **Initial Access**                          | T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application   |
| **Artifact Integrity and Tampering**                            | Artifacts might be tampered with, leading to the deployment of compromised or malicious code.                                                         | Use strong access controls, artifact signing, and checksum verification. Regularly audit and monitor repository access.                                | **Impact**                                  | T1485 - Data Destruction                    |
| **Unauthorized Access to Vulnerable Artifacts**                 | Unauthorized users may gain access to vulnerable artifacts, increasing the risk of exploitation.                                                      | Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and apply the principle of least privilege to restrict access.                                               | **Privilege Escalation** / **Credential Access** | T1078 - Valid Accounts                      |
| **Exposure of Vulnerable Artifacts through Misconfiguration**   | Misconfigurations may expose vulnerable artifacts to unauthorized parties or environments.                                                            | Regularly review repository configurations, enforce secure defaults, and ensure strong authentication and encryption.                                  | **Defense Evasion**                         | T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools         |
| **Inadequate Vulnerability Management Process**                 | Lack of a formalized vulnerability management process may result in the accumulation of insecure artifacts.                                           | Establish a formal vulnerability management process integrated with CI/CD pipelines for timely identification and remediation.                         | **Continuous Development**                  | T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter   |
| **Compromise of Dependency Trees**                              | Vulnerable artifacts could be included as dependencies in other projects, spreading vulnerabilities.                                                  | Implement dependency scanning during artifact review and ensure regular updates to secure versions.                                                    | **Supply Chain Compromise**                 | T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise             |
| **Insufficient Encryption of Stored Artifacts**                 | Artifacts without adequate encryption may be accessed or altered by unauthorized parties.                                                             | Ensure encryption at rest with strong standards and regular key rotation.                                                                              | **Defense Evasion**                         | T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host           |
| **Artifacts Not Properly Classified**                           | Vulnerable artifacts might not be properly classified, leading to their unintended use in critical environments.                                      | Classify and tag artifacts based on security status, and enforce policies to prevent vulnerable artifacts from being used in production.               | **Defense Evasion**                         | T1480 - Execution Guardrails                |
| **Supply Chain Attacks via Vulnerable Artifacts**               | Attackers may introduce vulnerabilities into artifacts within the supply chain, which are then stored and deployed.                                   | Conduct thorough security reviews and scanning of all third-party artifacts before storage. Implement secure supply chain management practices.         | **Initial Access** / **Execution**          | T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise             |
