## **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
### **Automated Threat Modeling System (ATMS)**

---

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Background**
The contemporary software ecosystem, with its intricate interconnections and diverse architectures, has expanded tremendously. As it has grown, so too has the universe of potential security threats. Traditional threat modeling methodologies, being manual and cumbersome, often lack the ability to adapt to this rapidly changing threat landscape. This emphasizes the urgent need for the ATMS.

#### **1.2 Objective**
To design and deploy the ATMSâ€”a tool engineered to revolutionize threat modeling. The goal is to equip organizations with a system that facilitates an automated and efficient threat modeling strategy, which incorporates the evaluation of both likelihood and the potential ramifications of threats.

#### **1.3 Scope**
ATMS seeks to:
- Centralize threat modeling endeavors.
- Pioneer a shift-left approach in cybersecurity.
- Integrate flawlessly within CI/CD pipelines.
- Adapt to shifting threat landscapes and compliance demands.

### **2. Business Requirements**

#### **2.1 Business Objective**
The ATMS envisions:
- Modernizing the threat modeling paradigm.
- Reducing the duration between vulnerability identification and resolution.
- Embedding a security-first mentality within teams.
- Seamless integration within prevalent software infrastructures.

  - Evaluate threats based on potential exploitability and ramifications.
  - Dynamic risk scoring based on industry metrics.
  
- **FR6 Reporting**:  
  - Detailed, segmented reports.
  - Visual threat landscapes.
  - Actionable insights and analytics.
  
- **FR7 Integration**:

- **FR11 User Management**:  
  - Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC).
  - Detailed audit trails.
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and other security measures.

#### **2.3 Non-functional Requirements (NFR)**

- **NFR1 Design**:  
  - Modular, scalable architecture.
  - Facilitate periodic updates without major overhauls.
  
- **NFR2 Security**:  
  - Multi-layered security protocols.
  - Regular security audits and patching.
