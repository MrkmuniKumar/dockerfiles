### **2.2 Functional Requirements (FR)**

1. **FR1: Threat Discovery**  
   **Description**: The ATMS should be capable of scanning, detecting, and cataloging a comprehensive range of known and potential threat vectors in varying environments. This includes threats associated with the infrastructure, application layers, and third-party components.

2. **FR2: Application Compatibility**  
   **Description**: Ensure compatibility across multiple application architectures. This includes support for web applications, mobile applications, IoT devices, and other technology platforms.

3. **FR3: Diagram Parsing**  
   **Description**: The ATMS should be able to interpret and extract data from architectural and flow diagrams. It should support popular file formats and decipher complex architectures to identify potential security touchpoints.

4. **FR4: Threat Categorization**  
   **Description**: Upon identification, threats should be systematically categorized based on predefined parameters such as type, severity, potential impact, and associated risk. Integration with standard models like STRIDE or OWASP should be facilitated.

5. **FR5: Threat Assessment**  
   **Description**: Beyond mere identification, the ATMS should assess each threat for potential impact, exploitability, and likelihood. This would involve scoring mechanisms and possibly integration with platforms like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

6. **FR6: Reporting**  
   **Description**: Generate detailed reports that clearly visualize threats, associated risks, and potential impact areas. These reports should be easy to interpret, segmented for different stakeholder views, and actionable.

7. **FR7: Integration**  
   **Description**: Facilitate integration with external threat intelligence sources, ensuring the system remains updated with the latest threat vectors and mitigation strategies.

8. **FR8: Mitigation Proposals**  
   **Description**: Beyond identification and assessment, the system should suggest countermeasures or mitigation strategies to address the detected threats, grounded in industry best practices.

9. **FR9: CI/CD Embedment**  
   **Description**: The ATMS should be embeddable within popular CI/CD platforms, facilitating real-time threat modeling and proactive security enforcement during development cycles.
