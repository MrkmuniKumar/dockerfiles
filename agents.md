### Explanation:

1. **Preventive Controls:** These controls are implemented to prevent security incidents before they occur. For example, restricting access to CI/CD pipelines is a preventive measure.

2. **Detective Controls:** These controls are designed to detect security incidents after they have occurred. For example, logging and monitoring activities allow you to detect unauthorized access or modifications.

3. **Steps for Implementation:** This column provides actionable steps for implementing each control, ensuring that they are practical and tailored to secure CI/CD pipelines in environments such as EKS, EC2, and Azure DevOps.
