### Objectives

#### 1. **Compliance**
   - **Objective:** The primary objective under compliance is to ensure that all organizational IT assets, including servers, workstations, network devices, and applications, adhere strictly to the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) guidelines. This will involve identifying all relevant STIG benchmarks applicable to the organization's infrastructure and systematically applying these benchmarks to ensure full compliance. Regular audits will be conducted to validate that all configurations meet or exceed the standards set forth in the STIG. Additionally, this initiative will ensure compliance with other regulatory frameworks such as NIST, GDPR, or HIPAA, depending on the organization's industry, by integrating these requirements with STIG guidelines.

   - **Additional Focus Areas:**
     - **Standardization:** Ensure consistent application of security hardening standards across all environments, minimizing the risk of configuration drift.
     - **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of all compliance activities, including the specific STIGs applied, exceptions granted, and justifications for any deviations.

#### 2. **Governance**
   - **Objective:** Under governance, the project will establish a comprehensive framework that integrates STIG-based security hardening into the organization's broader security strategy. This governance framework will outline the roles, responsibilities, and authority of various stakeholders, including IT security teams, compliance officers, and system administrators. It will also establish processes for continuous review and updating of security policies to adapt to new STIG releases or changes in the threat landscape.

   - **Additional Focus Areas:**
     - **Policy Integration:** Ensure that STIG guidelines are embedded into the organization's IT governance policies, creating a culture of security across all departments.
     - **Change Management:** Develop a robust change management process to ensure that all system updates and configuration changes are evaluated against STIG guidelines before implementation.

#### 3. **Reporting**
   - **Objective:** The reporting component of this project aims to establish a transparent and comprehensive reporting system that provides clear insights into the security posture of the organization based on STIG compliance. This system will generate regular reports for internal stakeholders, including IT management and executive leadership, as well as external auditors and regulators. Reports will cover key metrics such as compliance status, identified vulnerabilities, remediation progress, and any incidents of non-compliance.

   - **Additional Focus Areas:**
     - **Automated Reporting:** Leverage automation tools to streamline the generation of compliance reports, ensuring timely and accurate data collection and analysis.
     - **Dashboard Creation:** Implement dashboards that provide real-time visibility into STIG compliance across different systems, allowing for quick identification and resolution of potential issues.

#### 4. **Remediation**
   - **Objective:** The remediation objective focuses on establishing a proactive and systematic approach to address any security gaps identified during compliance audits or vulnerability assessments. This involves prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk level and implementing timely remediation actions to mitigate these risks. The remediation process will be supported by a continuous monitoring system that detects new vulnerabilities as they emerge and triggers prompt corrective measures.

   - **Additional Focus Areas:**
     - **Incident Response Integration:** Ensure that the remediation process is closely linked with the organization's incident response plan, enabling swift action in case of security breaches.
     - **Training and Awareness:** Provide ongoing training to IT staff on STIG guidelines and best practices for remediation, ensuring they are equipped to address vulnerabilities effectively.

   - **Post-Remediation Validation:** After remediation efforts, conduct thorough validation checks to confirm that the vulnerabilities have been fully resolved and that the systems are compliant with STIG standards. This validation process will involve both automated scanning tools and manual verification by security experts.

By addressing these objectives comprehensively, the organization will not only enhance its security posture but also establish a sustainable process for maintaining high levels of security and compliance in the long term.
