### Key Threats & Vulnerabilities Addressed:
1. **Data Encryption in S3**: Addressing vulnerabilities related to unencrypted S3 buckets and data transfer.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**: Encrypted communication between the application server and database/S3 to prevent eavesdropping.
3. **Unencrypted Credentials**: Ensuring database connection strings and API credentials are encrypted and stored securely.
4. **S3 Bucket Permissions**: Ensuring proper access control and least privilege principles for S3 bucket access.

### Mitigations:
- **Encryption of Data at Rest**: Use S3 server-side encryption (SSE) for artifacts stored in S3. Enable encryption keys using AWS KMS.
- **Encryption of Data in Transit**: Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between Artifactory, the database, and S3.
- **S3 Bucket Permissions**: Review and audit S3 bucket policies regularly to enforce least privilege. Disable public access where not required.
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure storage for credentials (such as AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables) to protect sensitive database and S3 access credentials.

This threat model now includes the necessary considerations for secure connectivity between the application server and the database, the application server and S3, while addressing data encryption and OWASP-related risks for JFrog Artifactory.
