Situation Based Interview Questions:
1. Threat Modeling (15 minutes)

Scenario: You are the security engineer for a new e-commerce platform that allows users to purchase and sell products online. The platform stores user data such as names, addresses, credit card information, and purchase history.

Task:

Identify the top 3 security threats this platform faces.
Explain how you would use a threat modeling framework (e.g., STRIDE) to identify these threats and their potential impact.
For one of the identified threats, propose a mitigation strategy.
Evaluation Criteria:

Understanding of threat modeling concepts and frameworks.
Ability to identify relevant threats for the given scenario.
Clear explanation of the chosen threat and its impact.
Well-defined mitigation strategy with justification.
2. Cloud Security IAM Domain (15 minutes)

Scenario: You are tasked with securing access to a new cloud storage bucket on AWS S3 that will store sensitive customer data.

Task:

Explain the concept of Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS.
Design an IAM policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket. Who should have access? What actions should they be allowed to perform (e.g., read, write, delete)?
How would you monitor access to the S3 bucket for potential suspicious activity?
Evaluation Criteria:

Understanding of IAM concepts and functionalities.
Ability to design a restrictive IAM policy for sensitive data.
Knowledge of access control mechanisms within IAM.
Awareness of IAM monitoring tools and practices.
3. Python Programming (15 minutes)

Scenario: You are building a Python script to automate the process of downloading weather data from a public API.

Task:

Write a Python script that fetches the current weather data for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from a reputable weather API (provide an example API if possible).
The script should extract relevant weather information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Optionally, format the output to display the weather information in a user-friendly way (e.g., print to console or write to a file).
Evaluation Criteria:

Ability to write functional Python code using libraries like requests and JSON.
Understanding of API calls and data extraction techniques.
Code clarity, efficiency, and proper error handling.
Bonus points for data formatting and user-friendliness.
These situation-based questions will allow you to assess the candidate's hands-on skills in threat modeling, cloud security (IAM), and Python programming within a practical context. By giving them 15 minutes for each question, you can gauge their thought process, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of the relevant concepts.
